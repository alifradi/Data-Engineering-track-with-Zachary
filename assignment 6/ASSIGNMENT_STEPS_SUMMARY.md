- âœ… Established clear escalation matrix

**Schedule Features:**
- **Week 1-2**: Alex Chen (9 AM - 5 PM)
- **Week 3-4**: Sarah Johnson (5 PM - 1 AM)
- **Week 5-6**: Mike Rodriguez (1 AM - 9 AM)
- **Week 7-8**: Lisa Wang (9 AM - 5 PM)

**Holiday Considerations:**
- Major holidays (Christmas, New Year): Senior engineers only
- Minor holidays: Normal rotation
- Thanksgiving and Independence Day: Mid-level engineers

---

### **Step 4: Comprehensive Runbook Creation**
- âœ… Created detailed runbooks for all 5 pipelines
- âœ… Included technical details, monitoring, and troubleshooting steps
- âœ… Standardized format across all runbooks
- âœ… Added business context and SLA requirements

**Runbook Components:**
- Pipeline overview and business impact
- Technical details (source systems, processing engines, schedules)
- Monitoring and alerting strategies
- Step-by-step troubleshooting procedures
- Data quality checks and validation

---

### **Step 5: Risk Assessment & Analysis**
- âœ… Identified technical, business, and operational risks
- âœ… Categorized risks by impact and probability
- âœ… Provided specific examples for each risk category
- âœ… Outlined risk mitigation strategies

**Risk Categories:**
1. **Technical Risks**: Data source failures, infrastructure issues, data quality problems
2. **Business Risks**: SLA violations, regulatory compliance, business logic errors
3. **Operational Risks**: Team availability, knowledge silos, tool dependencies

**Risk Examples:**
- Database connection timeouts
- Incorrect profit calculations
- Primary owner unavailable during incidents
- Schema changes without notification

---

### **Step 6: Success Metrics & KPIs**
- âœ… Defined measurable success criteria
- âœ… Established targets for pipeline reliability
- âœ… Set data quality benchmarks
- âœ… Created team performance metrics

**Success Metrics:**
- **Pipeline Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, 95% SLA compliance
- **Data Quality**: 99.5% completeness, 99.9% accuracy
- **Team Performance**: <15 min response time, <4 hours incident resolution
