# Assignment 8: Tableau Dashboard Creation Guide

## üìä **Assignment Overview**
Create two dashboards with Tableau Public using gaming data:
1. **Executive Dashboard** - High-level metrics for stakeholders
2. **Exploratory Dashboard** - Interactive analysis with filters

## üéÆ **Data Structure (UPDATED - Fixed Data Relationships)**

### **Data Files Available:**
- **`medals.csv`** - Medal types and point values
- **`matches.csv`** - Match information (maps, playlists, winners, duration)
- **`match_details.csv`** - Player performance in each match
- **`medals_matches_players.csv`** - Medal achievements by players (FIXED relationships)

### **Key Data Relationships (Now Consistent!):**
- **Each match has exactly 10 players** (from `match_details`)
- **Each match awards exactly 5 medals** (from `medals_matches_players`)
- **Player IDs are consistent** between performance and medal data
- **No more data inflation** - clean, meaningful relationships

### **Sample Data Values:**
- **Match Duration**: 1200-2100 seconds (20-35 minutes)
- **Player Performance**: 0-19 kills, 0-24 assists per match
- **Medal Points**: 25-300 points per medal type

## üîó **Data Relationships in Tableau**

### **Primary Relationships:**
1. **`matches.csv` ‚Üî `match_details.csv`**: Join on `match_id`
2. **`matches.csv` ‚Üî `medals_matches_players.csv`**: Join on `match_id`
3. **`medals.csv` ‚Üî `medals_matches_players.csv`**: Join on `medal_id`
4. **`match_details.csv` ‚Üî `medals_matches_players.csv`**: Join on `match_id` AND `player_id`

### **Why This Works Now:**
- **Player IDs are consistent** across all tables
- **No more many-to-many join issues**
- **Clean, meaningful relationships** between performance and achievements

## üìä **Dashboard Features to Highlight**
