## Dimensional data modeling

1- Use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions)  for temporaray table quering 

2- use of structs to compact data and create customized types

3- use of arrays to compact data

4- unnest of data for slice and dice operations

5- track changements and modeling for SCD (Slowly changing Dimensions)

6- incremental and one full methods for back filling tables

7- window functions for advanced data processing
